* **Educational Attainment:** The data is an estimation based on the responses to the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). The percentage represents the number of individuals that have earned a bachelor's degree or higher. Sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_educational_attainment).

* **Peace Index:** The US state index is based on an analysis of homicide, violent crime, policing, incarceration rates and the availability of small arms. The data is inversed and refactored for percentages instead of a numerical score. The higher the percentage, the more peaceful a state is considered. Sourced from [Vision of Humanity](http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/indexes/us-peace-index).

* **Above Poverty Rate:** The percentages represent the number of households per state that are living above the poverty rate (by household income). Sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_poverty_rate) and originally from the [United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/).

* **Non Religious:** Religion data is based on the percentage of individuals that do not identify as highly religious in each state. Sourced from the [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/29/how-religious-is-your-state/).
